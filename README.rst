Rats survival related to GMO toxicity
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A quick study of the variability in survival data from *Séralini's et al.* article "Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a
Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize"
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.005).

(color highlighting was added by myself to improve legibility)

A **randomly generated** survival curve:

Survival curve generation
=========================

Generation of random survival curve is done with the
`rats_survival_analysis.py` Python script.

The death time of rats is generated by random sampling from a
Weibull distribution, with a median and a scale that can be tuned.
